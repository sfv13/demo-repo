 My name is Stevie Vaughn, and I am a current student at Mississippi State University working on my BS in Elrctrical Engineering. I grew up in Tennesse and plan to attend to complete my Masters in Energy Engineering at the University of North Dakota. My goal is to work in the fields of power and energy to work towards a more efficient tomorrow.
